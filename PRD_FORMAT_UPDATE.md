# ðŸ“‹ PRD Format Update

## âœ… What Changed

The system now generates **Product Requirements Documents (PRD)** instead of simple "Refined Requirements". This provides a much more comprehensive and professional output format.

## ðŸŽ¯ New PRD Structure

The system now generates a complete PRD with **10 structured sections**:

### 1. **Overview**
- Product vision and purpose
- Clear description of what the product intends to do

### 2. **Problem Statement**
- What problem are we solving
- How it improves user's life or workflow
- Pain points and value proposition

### 3. **Debate Summary (Agent Perspectives)**
- Summary of all 5 AI agent perspectives
- Business Manager, Engineer, Designer, Customer, Product Manager
- Final consensus and decisions

### 4. **Objectives**
- High-level goals of the product
- Guiding principles for success
- Value delivery to users and business

### 5. **Scope**
- **In-Scope**: What will be delivered in this version
- **Out-of-Scope**: What will be excluded or deferred
- Prevents scope creep and ensures alignment

### 6. **Requirements**
- **Functional Requirements**: Features the product must have
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, scalability, security, usability

### 7. **User Stories**
- End-user perspective using "As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]"
- Ensures features are tied to user needs

### 8. **Trade-offs & Decisions**
- Compromises made during discussions
- Features deprioritized or postponed
- Reasoning behind decisions

### 9. **Next Steps**
- Concrete action items after PRD approval
- Development milestones, design deliverables
- Testing timelines, launch preparations

### 10. **Success Metrics**
- KPIs and benchmarks for measuring success
- User adoption, performance, satisfaction metrics
- Business and technical metrics
